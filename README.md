# CS3650 notes
Really bad Github with some notes from lecture in CS3650 Computer Systems taken during the Spring 2024 semester with Professor Gene Cooperman. 

There's junk in the files like memes, but buried deep within mostly useless information are some good notes? or at least I hope so

The notes were taken in Obsidian which is why some styling looks really bad and newlines aren't correctly translated (same for pictures)
